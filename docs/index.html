        <p>Hi, I'm Sam.</p>
        <p>I'm a C# software developer and I have a bit of an interest in video games :)
        <p>

          These are three of my favorite games:
        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/524220/NieRAutomata/">Nier: Automata</a><a

          </li>
          <li><a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/dark-souls/dark-souls-iii">The Dark Souls Franchise</a></li>
          <li><a href="http://www.furigame.com/">Furi</a></li>

    <h3> Squaredle Solver </h3>

    <div class="paragraph-with-image">
      <div>
        <p>
          My latest side project was based on "squaredle" - a word search game where words are found by drawing a path
          through a grid of letters. Letters get faded out, once all words using them have already been found.
        </p>
        <div id="squaredle-explanation-spacer">
          <br>
          <br>
          <br>
        </div>
        <p>
          Squardle is fun, but there is nothing quite like ruining the fun by writing a program that finds the words for
          me!
        </p>
      </div>

          The solver is written in C# and uses WPF for the UI
        </p>
        <p>
          The app searches for words in the current puzzle and then displays the path used to construct each word it
          found.
        </p>
        <p>
          The user can remove paths they have already tried by clicking and also mark individual letters as faded out. Both of these are used to filter down the paths that will be displayed.

    <h3 style="clear: both;"> Junior Software Developer </h3>

    <p>Since October 2022 I have worked full-time as a junior software developer for a sports betting company. I pretty much only use C# in this role.</p>

    <p>Writing software professionally has been a dramatically different experience compared to hacking things together
      in university. I find both approaches fun!</p>

    <h3> Computer Science Degree </h3>
    <p>I graduated and got my computer science degree from the University of Cambridge in 2022.</p>

    <p>The two courses I enjoyed the most were graphics and programming in C and C++.</p>

    <p>My final year project was a graphics project in which I
      used blender's python api to automate lighting experiments.</p>
