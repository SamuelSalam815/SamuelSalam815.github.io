    <p>Hi, I'm Sam.</p>
    <p>I'm a junior software developer keen to break into to video game development!</p>

    Some of my favorite games include:
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/524220/NieRAutomata/">Nier: Automata</a><a href="#footnote1">*</a>
      </li>
      <li><a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/dark-souls/dark-souls-iii">The Dark Souls Franchise</a></li>
      <li><a href="http://www.furigame.com/">Furi</a></li>
    </ul>


    <h3 style="clear:both"> Capabilities </h3>
    <p>
      I use C# daily in my full-time job and I'm currently learning to use unity to build games in my free time.
    </p>

    <p>
      I am familiar with both git and <a href="https://unity.com/solutions/version-control">Unity Version Control</a>
      (aka Plastic SCM) for version control.
    </p>

    <h2> Incident Log </h2>

    <h3> Squaredle Solver </h3>

    <p>
      My latest side project was started out of frustration!
      Squaredle is an online puzzle...
      So naturally I write a program to solve the puzzle for me.
    </p>

    <h3> Junior Software Developer </h3>

    <p>Since October 2022 I have worked full-time as a junior software developer for an asset management
      company.</p>

    <p>C# is the language of choice for all systems at my workplace!</p>

    <p>I had not written softaware professionally before graduating, and the experience is much different!</p>

    <h3> Computer Science Degree </h3>
    <p>I graduated and got my computer science degree from the University of Cambridge in 2022.</p>

    <p>The courses I enjoyed the most were graphics and programming in C and C++.</p>

    <p>My final year project was a lighting-based graphics project in which I tried to improve a lighting technique. I
      used blender's python api to automate my experiments.</p>
